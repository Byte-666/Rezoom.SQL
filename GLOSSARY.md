## RDBMS

Relational database management system, e.g. SQLite or MS SQL Server.

## SQL

Structured query language. The (mostly) standard language for interacting with an RDBMS. Pronounced like "sequel".

## migration

A SQL script intended to update the database schema, usually run on production databases when deploying new software
versions. Most migrations add new tables to the database and/or new columns to existing tables.

## type provider

An F# library that runs within the F# compiler to generate types at compile time.

## statically typed

Meaning the compiler knows the types of variables when it builds the program, and can detect mistakes in their usage
then, as opposed to at runtime.
